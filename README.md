# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

![Design preview for the Time tracking dashboard coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 35th Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

Completed a Frontend Mentor challenge designed to hone CSS Grid skills. This project provided an excellent chance to deepen my understanding of layout techniques. For added complexity, a JSON data file was included to practice integrating and managing data, making it a comprehensive exercise in both layout and data handling.

**Had fun building this!** ðŸš€
